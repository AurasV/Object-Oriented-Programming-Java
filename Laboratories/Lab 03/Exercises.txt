1) Implement class Card containing : enumeration Rank (Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Knight, Queen, King) 
and enumeration Suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and spades). Implement class  Hand which has an array of cards. 
Hand has methods addCard(Card c), deleteCard(Rank, Suit), sort(), display(). Cards are sorted first by suit and then by rank. 
If 2 cards are equal raise custom exceptions. Make Hand implement Storable (see below). Card should be immutable

 

 

2)  Implement class Course containing: String name, enumeration Type (Foundamental, Specialization, Discipline), 
enumeration Stream (English, French, German), int creditPoints. Class Contract has an array of courses with methods 
addCourse(Course), deleteCourse(type, stream, name) sort(), display(). Courses are sorted by stream, type, name. 
If 2 courses are equal raise a custom exception in method sort().Make Contract implement Storable (see below). 
Course should be immutable

 

 

Reading and writing from a text file

FileOutputStream outputFile=new FileOutputStream("info.txt");

OutputStreamWriter outputStream=new OutputStreamWriter(outputFile);

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(outputStream);       

FileInputStream inputFile=new FileInputStream("info.txt");

InputStreamReader reader=new InputStreamReader(inputFile);

BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(reader);

 

 

Create a new interface, Storable with a method “store(String file)” which writes in a file the attributes of the implementing object.
 (reuse toString() !).
