Implementation of compareTo

 

public int compareTo( Object aThat ) {

    final int BEFORE = -1;
    final int EQUAL = 0;
    final int AFTER = 1;
 
    //this optimization is usually worthwhile, and can
    //always be added
    if ( this == aThat ) return EQUAL;
    //primitive numbers follow this form
    if (this.attribute< aThat.attribute) return BEFORE;
    if (this. attribute > aThat.attribute) return AFTER;
    
//What if we use more attributes for comparison???

return EQUAL;

//references follow this form

return (this.attribute.compareTo(aThat.attribute);

}


Continue problems from last time. Implement Comparable for Account, compare Accounts based on their IBAN.
 DO NOT CREATE ANOTHER INTERFACE, implement the existing interface from java.lang

class Account implements Comparable{

public int compareTo(Object aThat)

......

}

Create a new interface, Storable with a method “store(String file)” which writes in a file the attributes of the implementing object.
 (reuse toString() !).
Hint

Reading and writing from a text file

FileOutputStream outputFile=new FileOutputStream("info.txt");

OutputStreamWriter outputStream=new OutputStreamWriter(outputFile);

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(outputStream);       

FileInputStream inputFile=new FileInputStream("info.txt");

InputStreamReader reader=new InputStreamReader(inputFile);

BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(reader);
