Problem 3 (optional, for homework)


Create the classes TouristicPackage and Attraction. A package has a name, id and price and also a list of attractions.
 An attraction has a name and location.

Create 10 different packages each one with 2-3 attractions. (make sure that some attractions repeat in more packages).
 Add the packages to a List<TouristicPackage>. This list represents the list of sold packages.

We are interested in determining which are the most popular attractions.
 For that we create a Map<Attraction,Integer> which stores how many times each attraction was bought.
 We populate this Map by parsing the List created earlier. Check the results.
 ( Attractions should be unique in order to be used as keys for the map, what does this imply? )

It is not enough to know just the number of times an attraction was bought because it depends on the total number of sales.
 We want to know the relative popularity of an attraction.
 For example if 5 touristic packages, each with 2 attractions, were bought and "Paltinis" as an attraction appeared 2 times
 it means that it has a relative popularity of 2/10. Create a Map<Attraction,Double>
  which stores the relative popularity of each attraction. Populate this Map by parsing the Map created earlier. Check the results.

Print for each attraction how many times it was bought and its relative popularity.
